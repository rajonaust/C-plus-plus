/* Constructor */

// A class constructor is a special member function of a class that is executed whenever create a new objects of that class .
// A constructor will have exact same name as the class .
// It does not have any return type at all , not even void . So it does not return a value .
// One class can have one or more constructors by changing number or data type of arguments .
// Constructors can be very useful for setting initial values for certain member variables .

/* Destructor */

// A destructor is a special member function of a class that is executed whenever an object of it's class goes out of scope or whenever the delete expression is applied to a pointer to the object of that class .
// A destructor will have exact same name as the class prefixed with a tilde (~) and it can neither return a value nor can it take any parameters .
// Destructor can be very useful for releasing resources before coming out of the program like closing files , releasing memories etc .
// It can be called by an object from another class or in same class .
// If a method / constructor of a class called recursively another only constructor , not any normal function of that class , then destructor method will also call for releasing resources for calling recursively those constructor .
// It only and only release resources , not change any variable's value and contdition of method of a class .

/* this keyword */

// This keyword refers the global variables and functions of class .
